# ABAQUS-Subroutines
FORTRAN subroutines for my meso-level simulations in Abaqus

Finite elements simulations in my papers, thesis, etc. -- references at the end of this file -- use these subroutines. Soubroutines for user materials (UMAT), loading amplitude (UAMP), and Mutli-point constraint (MPC) are called by Abaqus. Other subroutines in this file are called internally. Subroutines are evolved through time. Here is the final version as used in my PhD thesis.
